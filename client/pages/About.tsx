                  I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer based in Miami, Florida, with a strong focus on building high-quality web and mobile applications.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  &nbsp;I specialize in developing end-to-end solutionsâ€”from planning and designing intuitive user interfaces to implementing robust backend systems. Whether it's creating a product from scratch or improving an existing one, I bring a problem-solving mindset and a user-centered approach to every project.{" "}
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  My goal is to build applications that are not only functional and scalable but also engaging and easy to use.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to
                  open-source projects, or enjoying the great outdoors. I believe that the best
                  solutions come from understanding both the technical landscape and the human
                  experience.
